# Introduction

This course begins by introducing  basic concepts of data and its types. Topics on various methods and procedures of collecting, organizing, summarizing, presenting and analyzing the data are presented. Topics on relationship between two variables such as Regression and Correlation analysis are covered. The second portion of the course focuses on the probability theory. From the basic probability rules to the construction of all the well-known probability distributions like binomial, hyper-geometric, uniform and normal distributions are discussed. The course will finally introduce the inferential statistics which is further divided into estimation and hypothesis testing. It deals with the drawing of conclusions about various phenomena on the basis of real data collected on sample basis. The use of appropriate methods like Z-test, T-test, F-test, Chi-square test are explained with examples.
