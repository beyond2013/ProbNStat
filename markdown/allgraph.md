# GRAPHS

As already stated, diagrams are useful for representing spatial series. Diagrams fail when we want to represent a statistical series spread over a period of time, or a frequency distribution or two related variables in visual form. For such representations, graphs are employed.

**Graphs present the data in a simple, clear and effective manner, facilitate comparison between two or more than two statistical series, and help us in appreciating their significance readily.** Another advantage of graphs is that they provide an overall picture of a statistical series. Graphs are **also sometimes used to make predictions and forecasts.** Certain partition values can also be located graphically. But graphs are less accurate as they do not give minute details. Moreover, they cost considerable expenditure and time. 

## Construction of Graphs
In the construction of a graph, the first step is to take a starting point, known as the origin, in the left-hand bottom corner of the graph paper. Two straight lines perpendicular to each other are drawn through the origin. The horizontal line is called the X-axis or abscissa and the vertical line is labelled as Y-axis or ordinate. The two lines together are known as co-ordinate axes. Some suitable scales are selected along X-axis and Y-axis. Independent variable is taken along X-axis and dependent variable along Y-axis. Points are plotted and joined to get the required graph. 

While constructing a graph, the following points should be kept in mind:

(i) A scale and the form of representation is to be selected in such a way that the true impression of the data to be represented is given by the graph.

(ii) Every graph must have a clear and comprehensive title at top. Where necessary, sub-titles should be added.

(iii) The source of the data must be given. A key and footnotes should be provided when necessary.

(iv) The independent variable should always be placed on the horizontal axis.

(v) The vertical scale should always begin with zero, otherwise the graph will give a false impression. If, however, the first item of the data is quite large, a scale-break should be shown between zero and next member.

(vi) The horizontal axis does not have to begin with zero unless of course, the independent variable or the lower limit of the first class interval is zero. 

(vii) The axes of the graph should be properly labelled. Labels should clearly state both the variable and the units, e.g. "Distance" and "Kilometre". "Sales" and "Rupees", etc.

(viii) Curves if more than one, must be clearly distinguished either by different colours or by differentiated lines (solid, dashed, dot dashed).

(ix) The graph should not be loaded with too many curves.

Graphs can be divided into two main categories, namely: 
(a) Graphs of Time-Series or Graphs of Historical Data, and  
(b) Graphs of Frequency Distributions. The important graphs of frequency distributions are Histogram, Frequency Polygon, Frequency Curve and the Cumulative Frequency Curve or Ogive.

### Graph of Time Series—Historigram

A curve showing changes in the value of one or more items from one period of time to the next is known as the graph of a time series. This curve is also called a Historigram. Thus a historigram displays variations in time series dealing with prices, production, imports, population, etc. To construct a historigram, time is taken along X-axis and the values of the variable along Y-axis. Points are plotted and are then connected by means of Straight line segments to get the "Historigram".

**Example:** Following table gives the number of cars produced in Germany during the years 1929-1936. Draw a suitable graph.

Years | No of Cars
------|-----------
1929  | 98
1930  | 74
1931  | 68
1932  | 50
1933  | 99
1934  | 172
1935  | 245
1936  | 302



### Histogram

A histogram consists of a set of adjacent rectangles whose bases are marked off by class boundaries (not class
limits) on the X-axis and whose heights are proportional to the frequencies associated with respective classes. The area of each rectangle represents the respective class frequencies. This is one of the most important graphical representation of a frequency distribution. When the class-intervals are equal, the rectangles all have the same width and their heights directly represent the class frequencies, that is they are numerically proportional to the frequencies in the respective classes. The following figure shows the histogram for the frequency distribution of Example 2.3

If the class-intervals are not all equal, the height of the rectangle over an unequal class-interval, is to be adjusted because it is area and not height that measures frequency. This means that the height of a rectangle must be proportionally decreased if the length of the corresponding class-interval increases. For example, if the length of a class-interval becomes double, then the height of the rectangle is to be halved so that the area, being the fundamental property of the rectangle of a histogram, remains unchanged. This sort of rescaling is necessary so that the correct pattern of the distribution is to be conveyed.

When the frequencies in a frequency distribution are given against the class-marks $x_i$ of equal class-intervals of width $h$, a histogram is constructed by drawing vertical lines (dotted) whose heights correspond to the respective class-frequencies at the class-marks marked off on the axis of $X$ and erecting a series of adjacent rectangles with widths equal to $x_i \pm \frac{h}{2}$ (i.e. half of the width is taken on either side of $x_i$).

It is important to note that in the construction of a histogram, we assume that within any one class, the values of the variable are evenly spread out between the class-boundaries. A histogram which must not be confused with the historigram (graph of a time series) is useful in forming a rough idea of the overall pattern and shape of the frequency distribution.

### Frequency polygon

Frequency polygon is a graphic form of a frequency distribution, which is constructed by plotting the points $(x_i, f_i)$ where $x_i$ is the class-mark of the ith class and $f_i$ is the corresponding frequency, and then connecting them by straight line segments provided the class-intervals are equal. 

In case of unequal class intervals, heights of unequal classes are adjusted by using the same technique that was used for histogram. It can also be obtained by joining the tops of the successive rectangles in the histogram by means of straight line segments. The graph drawn in this way does not reach the horizontal axis. But a polygon, as we know, is a closed figure having many sides. It is therefore customary to add "extra" class marks at both ends of the distribution with zero class frequencies so that the polygon does form a closed figure with the horizontal axis. This should be done even if the curve ends in the minus part of the graph. The frequency polygon for the frequency distribution of weights in Example 2.2 is given below:


A frequency polygon which can be used for comparing two or more data sets, gives roughly the position of the mode, some idea of skewness and Kurtosis of the curve (these terms are defined later). 

### Frequency Curve

When a frequency polygon or a histogram constructed over class intervals made sufficiently small for a large number of observations, is smoothed, it approaches a continuous curve, called a frequency curve. The concept of a frequency curve is of great importance in statistics. Mathematically, the curve is represented by the relation y = f(x) and has an important property concerning its area. The following graph represents histogram and frequency curve for the frequency distribution of the mean annual death rates of Example 2.3.

### Cumulative Frequency Polygon or Ogive. A cumulative

Frequency polygon, popularly known as Ogive is a graph obtained by plotting the cumulated frequencies of a distribution against the upper or lower class boundaries depending upon whether the cumulation is of the "less than" or "more than" type, and the points are joined by straight line segments. Because of its likeness to an architectural moulding called an ogee, a cumulative frequency polygon is called an Ogive. An Ogive, when the cumulation is of less-than type, is constructed by plotting the points $(xi + h/2, F_i)$ where $x_i + h/2$ is the upper class-boundary of the ith class and $F_i$ is the cumulative frequency of the ith class, and connecting the successive points by straight line segments. The polygon should start from zero at the lower boundary of the first interval, i.e. the point $(x_i — h/2, 0)$ is plotted and joined, and to have a polygon, the last point is also joined with the last upper class-boundary. In case of unequal classes, we merely join the unequally spaced points.

If relative frequencies are used, the cumulative frequency polygon rises from the value 0 at the left to the value 1 at the right. A smoothed Ogive is called an Ogive curve, which is often used to locate the partition values such as the median, quartiles, percentiles, etc. of a frequency distribution.

A percentage cumulative frequency polygon or curve may also be drawn by expressing the cumulative frequencies as percentages of the total frequency and then connecting the plotted percentages against upper class boundaries. This graphic device is useful for comparing two or more frequency distributions as they are adjusted to a uniform standard.

### Ogive for a Discrete Variable
When a variable X is discrete, its cumulative frequency polygon consists of horizontal line segments between any two successive values and has a jump of height $f_i$ at each value of $x_i$. In other words, the cumulative distribution increases only in jumps and is constant between jumps. For the purposes of illustration, the cumulative frequency polygon drawn for the frequency distribution of assistants in Example 2.4, is shown below:


This graph shows that the cumulative frequency polygon is stepped. Such a function is called a step function.

### Types of Frequency Curves

The frequency distributions occurring in practice, usually belong to one of the following four types:

(i) **The Symmetrical Distributions.** A frequency distribution or curve is said to be symmetrical if values equidistant from a central maximum have the same frequencies, i.e. the curve can be folded along the central maximum in such a way that the two halves of the curve coincide. The Normal curve is an important example of a symmetrical distribution.

(ii) **The Moderately Skewed or Asymmetrical Distributions.** A frequency distribution or curve is said to be skewed when it departs from symmetry. Here the frequencies tend to pile up at one end or the other end of the distribution or curve. This is the most common pattern encountered in practice.

(iii) **The Extremely Skewed or J -shaped distributions.** Here the frequencies run up to a maximum at one end of the range, having the shape of the letter J or its reverse. Most of the distributions in economic or medical statistics belong to extremely skewed distributions.

(iv) **The U-shaped Distributions.** In such frequency distributions or curves, the maximum frequencies occur at both ends of the range and a minimum towards the centre, shaped more or less like the letter U. A distribution of this type is rare. 

### Ratio Charts or Semi-logarithmic Graphs. 
In the ordinary types of graph, the scales used are called the natural scales or the arithmetic scales. These graphs can only be used to compare the absolute changes in values because the ordinary graph paper, also known as arithmetic paper, is so ruled that equal intervals anywhere on the paper represent equal differences or amounts. More often we are interested in studying the relative changes or ratios. The relative changes or ratios can be displayed and compared by the slope of straight line when the logarithms of the values are plotted on an arithmetic paper. In practice, the difficulty of looking up logarithms can be dispensed with by using another type of graph paper, called Semi-logarithmic paper or ratio paper. A semi-logarithmic paper or ratio paper is so constructed that equal intervals on the vertical axis indicate equal ratios or rates of change, while equal intervals on the horizontal axis represent equal differences or amounts of change. Thus the essential feature of a Semi-logarithmic chart is that one axis has a logarithmic scale and the other has arithmetic scale.

Graphs obtained by plotting the values on a semi-logarithmic paper or ratio paper and joining the successive points by means of straight line segments are called Semi-logarithmic graphs or Ratio charts. They are generally used when 

(i) the relative rates of change are to be compared; 
(ii) visual comparisons are to be made between two or more series which differ widely in magnitude: and 
(iii) the data are to be examined to see whether they are characterized by a constant rate of change. 

A ratio chart possesses the following characteristics:

(i) There is no zero line on the logarithmic scale as the logarithm of zero is minus infinity.

(ii) A geometric progression when plotted on semi-logarithmic paper, forms a straight line, as the logarithms of a geometric progression form an arithmetic progression.

(iii) The slope of the logarithmic scale variable indicates the rate at which the variable is changing (i.e. increasing or decreasing).

(iv) In case of two or more curves, the curve having the steepest slope, has the largest rate of change.

(v) Equal slopes (in case of parallel curves) indicate equal rates of change. _
